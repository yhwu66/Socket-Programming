a. Name: Yuhua Wu
b. Student ID: 8513508483
c. I have completed all the operations mentioned in the document(including optional part):
   1. CHECK BALANCE: Check Wallet of a centain user
   2. TXCOINSï¼š make transactions between users in the network
   3. TXLIST: get list of all transactions in order
   4. STATS: get statistical result with a summary of all the transactions and provides a list of all users the client has made transactions with a certain user
d. There are 6 source code files:
   1. serverM.c: the main server get the command from the clientA/clientB, then it sends request to the serverA, serverB and serverC, after getting response from the serverA, serverB and serverC, it deal with the response and then send the result to clientA/clientB.
   2. serverA.c: serverA has a log file "block1.txt" which stores part of the transactions, it send the information about the transactions to the main server when requested.
   3. serverB.c: serverB has a log file "block2.txt" which stores part of the transactions, it send the information about the transactions to the main server when requested.
   4. serverC.c: serverC has a log file "block3.txt" which stores part of the transactions, it send the information about the transactions to the main server when requested.
   5. clientA.c: clientA sent command(CHECK BALANCE, TXCOINS, TXLIST and STATS) to the main server and output the results.
   6. clientB.c: clientB sent command(CHECK BALANCE, TXCOINS, TXLIST and STATS) to the main server and output the results.
   Type `make` to compile all the files
   NOTICE: Please put the log files "block1.txt", "block2.txt" and "block3.txt" in the folder before starting the servers.
e. On Screen Messages Examples
   use following command to start 4 servers:
   ./serverM
   ./serverA
   ./serverB
   ./serverC
